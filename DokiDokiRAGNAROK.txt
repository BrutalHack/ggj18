--- Time to Transmit Some Wealth! ---

My name is Olaf!
I am a true Viking and, thus, pretty much a certified badass.
Yet I've never actually raided a village before!
I'm so embarrassed! All the other Vikings laugh at me. Sometimes I cry a little, but in a badass way.
Then suddenly, after a long night of mead-based partying...
--- Odin appears in a dream ---
O: Brave Warrior... It is I, Allfather Odin...
V: What?! Is this a dream?!
O: ...no. It's Odin. I JUST said that.
V: Oh. Right.
O: Anyhow. Brave Warrior... I command you...
O: Go forth and pillage! For the glory of the Vikings!
		-> (grunt affirmatively)	
			O: Then go out and conquer!
			And suddenly... I wake up!
		-> (grunt rejectingly)
			O: Wow, you're no fun.
			--- super-fast credits roll ---
			--- GAME OVER ---

Squinting through heavy eyelids, I rise from my fearsome powernap.
I take a moment to gather myself.
And then I pretty much begin pillaging immediately.

--- World Map!
	Choose:
	-> Brittany
		An island full of craven, noodle-armed dudes.
		Prime pillaging material. Raid your little heart out, mighty viking!
	-> Iceland
		You hear the siren call of easy loot from the horizon...
		Must be those Icelanders. Those guys are, like, UNREASONABLY rich.
	-> Normandy
		If you set out to terrorize costal villages, this is THE place to go.
		It's basically Las Vegas, just with less stealing.
Go pillage?
	-> Pillage GO!
	-> (grunt undecisively)
	
--- Brittany
Your boundless lust for treasure makes your mighty viking gaze wander northward...
You heard of truly ludicrous riches in this territory. Time to put those rumors to the test!
With utmost determination, you engage the horizon in a STARING CONTEST.
You keep your eyes fixed on the waves ahead. It is truly the most powerful of navigating techniques.
Absolutely nothing shall escape your powerful peepers.
And just as the merciless northern winds start encrusting your eyes with delicious seasalt...
...a coastal village appears in your sights seductively!
B: ...OHHH!!!! What's this? A viking!
V: !
B: I've never seen one before! Hello!
--- PHASE 1
B: I'm BRITTANY-CHAN! How do you do, Mr. Viking?
	-> Hello Brittany. I'd like to plunder your village.
		B: Oh, Mr. Viking! I bet you say that to ALL the villages you plunder! ( => Happy)
		--- Odin appears! ---
		O: That's it, brave viking! You have begun PILLAGING!
		O: Before your next action - listen closely!
		O: You might spot some CLUES for the best course of action...
		--- Odin disappears ---
		B: To tell the truth, I'm a little nervous... Not like you confident seafarers.
		B: I heard that you vikings even grow more powerful through something called LIQUID COURAGE!(Clue: Mead powers you up)
		--- Action time! ---
	-> I'm doing fine. Thanks for asking.
		B: Haha, how polite! Most visitors are much more coarse... Those ruffians just don't know how to properly loot a village. ( => Happy)
		--- Same events as before with Odin, same clue ---
	-> (grunt plunderingly)
		--- ( => Angry)
		--- CLUE: Attacking England is effective, but only the first time, and when the target is angry.
	-> (start with confused pillaging motions)
		B: Uh, what are you doing?
		B: This is kinda awkward... What if the Isle of Man sees us like this? ( => Sweatdrop)
		--- Odin's tutorial, same as first time ---
		B: But, I shouldn't say that, when we barely know each other...
		B: Is pillaging in such a straightforward manner common to YOUR FAITH? (Clue: Praise Odin is effective with Sweatdrop)
--- ACTION!
	-> Raid	(more effective when: drunk, happy)
		->(neutral)
		->(happy)
		->(drunk)
		->(happy & drunk)
		->(very drunk)
	-> Drink Mead (neutral, but powers up Raid)
		->(first time)
			B: What...?!
			B: What unparalleled drinking speed! I can see why they call you vikings the HONEYED MAELSTROM!
			B: They do call you that, don't they?
		->(subsequent times)
			B: CHUG CHUG CHUG! Amaing, Mr. Viking!
			B: Just how do you stay this thirsty all the time?!
	-> Praise Odin (more effective when sweatdrop, causes happy)
		->(first time when sweatdrop or angry)
			B: Ah, I see! So that's what viking culture is like!
		->(second time when sweatdrop or angry)
		->(subsequent times when sweatdrop or angry)
		--- ODIN TIP! --- (no proceeding dialog when not sweatdrop or angry)
	-> Attack England (more effective when angry, but only once)
		->(when not angry)
			B: Oh, please... Attacking the heartland right away?
			B: You can't expect that to work when I've still got my COMPOSURE!
		->(when angry)
			B: Ugh...!!! How can this be?!
			B: You deliberately put me off-guard to strike at my oafish, yet beloved royal family?
			B: Haha! I underestimated you! You lead a mean raid, Mr. Viking!
			B: But don't overdo it, okay?
		->(when already having attacked England when angry before)
			B: Hey! Knock it off! I thought I told you not to overdo it!
