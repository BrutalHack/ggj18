--- Time to Transmit Some Wealth! ---

My name is Olaf!
I am a true Viking and, thus, pretty much a certified badass.
Yet I've never actually raided a village before!
I'm so embarrassed! All the other Vikings laugh at me. Sometimes I cry a little, but in a badass way.
Then suddenly, after a long night of mead-based partying...
--- Odin appears in a dream ---
O: Brave Warrior... It is I, Allfather Odin...
V: What?! Is this a dream?!
O: ...no. It's Odin. I JUST said that.
V: Oh. Right.
O: Anyhow. Brave Warrior... I command you...
O: Go forth and pillage! For the glory of the Vikings!
		-> (grunt affirmatively)	
			O: Then go out and conquer!
			And suddenly... I wake up!
		-> (grunt rejectingly)
			O: Wow, you're no fun.
			--- super-fast credits roll ---
			--- GAME OVER ---

Squinting through heavy eyelids, I rise from my fearsome powernap.
I take a moment to gather myself.
And then I pretty much begin pillaging immediately.

--- World Map!
	Choose:
	-> Brittany
		An island full of craven, noodle-armed dudes.
		Prime pillaging material. Raid your little heart out, mighty viking!
	-> Iceland
		You hear the siren call of easy loot from the horizon...
		Must be those Icelanders. Those guys are, like, UNREASONABLY rich.
	-> Normandy
		If you set out to terrorize costal villages, this is THE place to go.
		It's basically Las Vegas, just with less stealing.
Go pillage?
	-> Pillage GO!
	-> (grunt undecisively)
	
--- Brittany
Your boundless lust for treasure makes your mighty viking gaze wander northward...
You heard of truly ludicrous riches in this territory. Time to put those rumors to the test!
With utmost determination, you engage the horizon in a STARING CONTEST.
You keep your eyes fixed on the waves ahead. It is truly the most powerful of navigating techniques.
Absolutely nothing shall escape your powerful peepers.
And just as the merciless northern winds start encrusting your eyes with delicious seasalt...
...a coastal village appears in your sights seductively!
B: ...OHHH!!!! What's this? A viking!
V: !
B: I've never seen one before! Hello!
--- PHASE 1
B: I'm BRITTANY-CHAN! How do you do, Mr. Viking?
	-> Hello Brittany. I'd like to plunder your village.
		B: Oh, Mr. Viking! I bet you say that to ALL the villages you plunder! ( => Happy)
		--- Odin appears! ---
		O: That's it, brave viking! You have begun PILLAGING!
		O: Before your next action - listen closely!
		O: You might spot some CLUES for the best course of action...
		--- Odin disappears ---
		B: To tell the truth, I'm a little nervous... Not like you confident seafarers.
		B: I heard that you vikings even grow more powerful through something called LIQUID COURAGE!(Clue: Mead powers you up)
	-> I'm doing fine. Thanks for asking.
		B: Haha, how polite! Most visitors are much more coarse... Those ruffians just don't know how to properly loot a village. ( => Happy)
		--- Same events as before with Odin, same clue ---
	-> (grunt plunderingly)
		B: W-What are you insinuating, Mr. Viking?
		B: Are - are your grunts some sort of communication? How rude! At least use words when you address a simple British fishing village! ( => Angry)
		--- Odin's tutorial, same as first time ---
		B: Ah! Now you made me all flustered...
		B: Just what are you trying to pull by making me LOSE MY COMPOSURE, Mr. Viking?! (Clue: Attacking England works when angry)
	-> (start with confused pillaging motions)
		B: Uh, what are you doing?
		B: This is kinda awkward... What if the Isle of Man sees us like this? ( => Sweatdrop)
		--- Odin's tutorial, same as first time ---
		B: But, I shouldn't say that, when we barely know each other...
		B: Is pillaging in such a straightforward manner common to YOUR FAITH? (Clue: Praise Odin is effective with Sweatdrop)
--- ACTION!
	-> Raid	(more effective when: drunk, happy)
		->(neutral)
			B: Wow. That's some ADEQUATE raiding!
			B: Uh, I mean, in a good way.
		->(happy)
			B: Oh, what great raiding technique!
		->(drunk)
			B: Oh...?! Your pillaging has grown more powerful than before!
			B: Just how high is your plunderlevel?!
		->(happy & drunk)
			B: Guh...! Ridiculous!
			B: Have you truly mastered the parallel coastline razing technique in such a short time?!
			B: Haha! Your pillaging woos and entices me... you scoundrel!
		->(very drunk)
			B: S-Such raiding power!!!
			B: Look how many exclamation marks you made me use! I'm... I'm lacking vocabulary to do your relentless village pummeling justice!
			B: Hmmm... Plunderealistic?
			B: Sounds good! Plunderealistic job, Mr. Viking!!!
	-> Drink Mead (neutral, but powers up Raid)
		->(first time)
			B: What...?!
			B: What unparalleled drinking speed! I can see why they call you vikings the HONEYED MAELSTROM!
			B: They do call you that, don't they?
		->(subsequent times)
			B: CHUG CHUG CHUG! Amaing, Mr. Viking!
			B: Just how do you stay this thirsty all the time?!
	-> Praise Odin (more effective when sweatdrop, causes happy)
		->(first time when sweatdrop or angry)
			B: Ah, I see! So that's what viking culture is like!
			B: I'm glad you could demonstrate this aspect of your rich viking history to me.
			B: I'm already feeling much better!
		->(second time when sweatdrop or angry)
			B: Wow! You must really look up to this Odin guy, Mr. Viking!
			B: Oh, I just can't stay mad at you adorable warlords.
		->(subsequent times when sweatdrop or angry)
			B: Ha... Classic Odin.
		--- ODIN TIP! --- (no proceeding dialog when not sweatdrop or angry)
	-> Attack England (more effective when angry, but only once)
		->(when not angry)
			B: Oh, please... Attacking the heartland right away?
			B: You can't expect that to work when I've still got my COMPOSURE!
		->(when angry)
			B: Ugh...!!! How can this be?!
			B: You deliberately put me off-guard to strike at my oafish, yet beloved royal family?
			B: Haha! I underestimated you! You lead a mean raid, Mr. Viking!
			B: But don't overdo it, okay?
		->(when already having attacked England when angry before)
			B: Hey! Knock it off! I thought I told you not to overdo it!
--- PHASE 2
B: Well, I feel like we already got to know each other better.
B: It's not every day you have fire set to your coastline in such a personable manner.
B: Why don't you tell me something about yourself?
	-> I'm a badass vegetarian.
		B: Wow, that's so interesting!
		B: I feel like a responsible diet is an often underestimated aspect of proper vikanism.
		B: Such as mead. I heard successive drinks have GREAT CUMULATIVE EFFECTS! ( => Clue: multiple drinks boost the next Raid even more)
	-> You don't want to know about my tormented past that has left me so tragically handsome.
		B: But I do! Tell me what tragedy has ravaged you with such handsomeness. ( => Happy)
		B: Or better yet, don't! Let's make that backstory mysterious as well.
	-> I'm shy.
		B: Oh, don't worry - so am I!
		B: But with the support of my friends, and by believing in myself, I managed to complete my character arc.
		B: Truly, I have become a stronger, more confident British fishing village for it!
		B: We really are alike, Mr. Viking! ( => Happy)
	-> (scream unintelligibly)
		B: Uuuuuh... I didn't quite catch that. ( => Sweatdrop)
--- PHASE 3
B: Tell me, uuuuh... why did you chose to sail here, when you had so many rich, defenseless settlements to chose from?
	-> There was just something about the way your inhabitants flee in terror from the Viking hordes.
		B: Yes, they do tend to do that.
		B: I don't know... Whenever I witness you mercilessly tormenting my populace, destroying their livelihoods and taking their possessions...
		B: ...I just feel such a warmth in my heart! ( => Happy)
		B: Though that might just be from you setting the thatched roofs on fire.
	-> Do I need any special reason to be a huge badass all the time?
		B: I guess not.
		B: Being badass just seems to come natural to you vikings!
		B: Perhaps it's the MEAD. It's healthy, improves your raiding capibilities and generally improves your outlook on life!
	-> I literally have no idea.
		B: ...huh.
		B: Well, this is awkward, then. ( => Sweatdrop)
	-> Sorry, I was distracted by those rich, defenseless settlements. You were saying?
		B: Oh, Mr. Viking, that's so awful of you! ( => Angry)
		B: You broke the will of my peasants... but did you have to break my heart, too?!
		B: Sometimes I think you're just making me angry TO ATTACK SOMEWHERE ELSE!( => Clue: Attacking England is effective when angry)
--- PHASE 4
B: But still...
B: I can't help but feel that this meeting was destiny!
B: Uuuuuh... But don't take this the wrong way!
B: I just think we could be very good friends.
	-> Brittany, I want to be more than just conquerbuddies.
		B: Huh?! ( => Sweatdrop)
		B: D-Don't be stupid!
		B: It's not like I want you to subjugate my populace! B-Baka!
	-> Friendship is one of the many emotions I have replaced with rage.
		B: Wow, that must be very convenient.
		B: Then you don't have to feel as many things. You'd have much more efficient feelings that way!
		B: Your belief in your badass gods must help you KEEP YOUR EMOTIONS IN CHECK. ( => Clue: Praising Odin also resets Sweatdrop/Angry to neutral)
	-> You cut my life into pieces. This is my last resort.
		B: Now, now, let's not quote any lyrics we might regret later.
		B: But I appreciate your honesty! ( => Happy)
	-> (start crying uncontrollably, but in a badass way)
		B: Mr. Viking?! Some kind of liquid is leaking from your eyes!
		B: Is it the blood of your enemies?! Or pure mead?!
		B: Oh, you're... crying.
		B: I must admit, that seems like the least likely viking-related liquid... ( => Sweatdrop)
--- PHASE 5
B: I... I just don't know if I'm ready for the next step!
B: I mean, could I really commit? Could YOU really commit?
B: Just think of all you'd have to give up to pillage my village!
	-> Can't I just be a simple viking, head over heel in bloodlust?
		B: Haha, you're right. Bloodlust truly is a powerful emotion.
		B: Why shouldn't we just give in to our emotions, and be just conqueror and conqueree?
		B: It could be so simple. ( => Happy)
	-> I refuse to think in general.
		B: Oh, that is so like you!
		B: And somewhat worrying.
		B: But mostly, so like you! ( => Happy)
	-> Heehee. That rhymed. 
		B: ...what?
		B: I mean... Yeah! It does! But that's not the point! ( => Angry)
	-> I'm sorry, I was just thinking of those other rich, defenseless settlements again.
		B: What?!
		B: You're so heartless! Why do you disrespect my feelings in such a way?
		B: You can't just invade a foreign nation and expect a subjugated village not to feel ANY affection! ( => Angry)
		B: It's over!!! ( => Instant DEFEAT scene)
--- PHASE 6
B: I... I just have to go out and say it. 
B: With all what you're doing for me, Mr. Viking... You can't mean...
B: You... wouldn't really conquer me for the Danish King Canute's realm, would you?
	-> Canute, not CAN NOT.
		B: Oh, Mr. Viking...
	-> Uuuuh, I don't really know this Canute guy.
		B: Oh. Uh, neither do I, actually.
		B: Now this is an awkward note to go out on...
		B: Shall we just see where an afternoon of relaxed pillaging takes us?
	-> I'd conquer you for noone... but for love.
		B: What a cheesy line!
		B: Yet it fits perfectly to your rancid viking smell.
		B: It's like sour milk... meets fierce invader passion.
		B: Oh, Mr. Viking...
	-> (belch with the reverberance of a thousand drinks)
		B: Oh, Mr. Viking!
		B: You just ALWAYS know what to say!
--- VICTORY
Success! You could overcome your differences and find common battleground.
The British village was pillaged, and razed to the ground!
The fields burn, the huts are ruined, the village treasures have been stolen.
Truly a happy end for everyone involved.
Praise Odin!
--- DEFEAT
Too tragic... In the end, it was not meant to be.
Our brave viking could just not fulfill plucky Brittany's plundering desires.
The British village rejected Olaf, and was later attacked by a fierce, handsome raiding party from, I dunno, probably Denmark.
Do not fret... It happens to the best of vikings.
